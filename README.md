# Moving-Vehicle-Classification-HOG
## Project Objectives
The goal of the project is detecting the moving vehicle on the highway from a web camera and classify the vehicle into passenger cars and large trucks. In this project, I'm using HOG descriptor to decribe the data features and SVM classification to classify them.
## Building Environement
* Python 2.x.x
* Opencv 
* Scikit-learn python package
## Project Description
### Background Extraction
As the project is working on a real-time video detection, it's more difficult to extract a background image than image detection. 
### Collecting the data
### Backgrond Subtraction
### Featrue Extraction with HOG
### Feature Training with SVM
### Test the result
